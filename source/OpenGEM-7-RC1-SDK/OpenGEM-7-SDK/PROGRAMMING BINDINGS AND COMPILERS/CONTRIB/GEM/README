	    documentation.
* INCLUDE  - The headers used when compiling with DJGPP.
* LIB      - The bindings as a DJGPP library.
* SAMPLE   - The SAMPLE directory from the GEM PTK. This contains the

            applications.
* SRC      - The 32-bit source code for the library and sample applications.
* TOOLS    - The TOOLS directory from the GEM PTK. This contains 16-bit
            binaries of the sample applications, and the Resource Editor
            (RCS.APP).
