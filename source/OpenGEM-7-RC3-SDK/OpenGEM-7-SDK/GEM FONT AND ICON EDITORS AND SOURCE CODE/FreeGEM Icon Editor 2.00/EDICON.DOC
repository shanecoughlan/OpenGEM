EDICON v2.01                                         John Elliott, 9 June 2000
==============================================================================

  EDICON is a program to edit the icon files used by two Digital Research
products: the GEM desktop (DESKTOP.APP) and ViewMAX (VIEWMAX.EXE).

Release History
===============

2.01: Modified so adding the 73rd icon to a file fails instead of crashing.
2.00: Initial release under GPL.
1.9x: Beta releases


Installation
============

1. Copy EDICON.APP and EDICON.RSC to a directory in your search path -
  in GEM/3, I recommend \GEMAPPS.

2. Under GEM: Highlight EDICON.APP, select "Configure application" from the
  "options" menu, and set up as follows:
              Document types:    ICN ICO
              Application type:  GEM
              Needs full memory: No
              Memory required:   256k
              Icon type:         Whatever you want!

  Then select "Save desktop" from the "options" menu.

3. Under ViewMAX: Highlight EDICON.APP, select "Configure application" from
  the "options" menu, and set up as follows:

              Takes parameters:   [ ]
              Document types:     ICN ICO
              Icon type:          Whatever

  Then select "Save preferences" from the "options" menu.
  Note that to use EDICON from ViewMAX, you will need a working GEM
 installation as well.


Use
===

  Start EDICON by clicking its icon, or by double-clicking an icon file.
If you double-click an icon file, it will be opened within EDICON; otherwise
EDICON will start with no files open.

  When you open a file, all its icons appear in a window. Double-click an
icon to edit it.

  In the case of a Windows .ICO file, only mono and 16-colour icons are
loaded; and the 16-colour icons are converted to mono. If you then save the
.ICO file again, you will be left with a file containing only mono icons.

Drag and drop
=============
  To delete an icon from a file, drag it out of its window onto the desktop.
You will then be able to confirm or cancel the deletion.
  To duplicate an icon, drag it to another place in the same window, and
choose "Copy icon" from the pop-up menu that appears.
  To copy or move an icon from one file to another, drag it from one window
to another. If you drag the icon onto the top of another icon of the same
size, you also have the option to replace the old icon with the new one.
  You can also drag an icon into an editor window to replace the
currently loaded icon.

The Icon editor
===============
  When you double-click an icon, the icon editor window appears. At the left
is the icon bitmap, and at the right is a preview window, a colour chooser
and an "Edit" button that can be used to change the caption. The four
colours are:

* Dark blue: Foreground
* White:     Background
* Cyan:      Transparent
* Dark cyan: Foreground in GEM icons; "reversed" in Windows icons.

  These colours are user-configurable using Edit | Settings - see below.

  Below these are two larger colour boxes; click on them to set the foreground
or background colours for the icon. Icon colour is not saved in .ICO or RCS
.ICN files, only in desktop icon sets.

  GEM icons can have either type of "foreground" colour.

  In the GEM/2 or GEM/3 desktop icons, "Icon 4" contains the images used to
highlight drives and folders. In this image, the colours mean:

* Dark blue: Both highlights
* White:     Folder highlight only
* Cyan:      Neither highlight
* Dark cyan: Drive highlight only

The File menu
=============
  This menu has five options:

New...       Create a new icon database from scratch.
Open...      Open a file. You can have multiple icon files loaded at once.
Save         Save the current file.
Save As...   Save the current icon database under a new name, and maybe in
             a new format as well.
Quit         Quit the program.

  The Save and Save As options are not available if the foreground window is
for an icon editor rather than an icon file.

The Edit menu
=============
  Copy, Cut and Paste are only applicable while an icon editor window is open.
All three items work on the entirety of an image. 

Edit | Settings
---------------
  The Settings command allows you to choose the colours used in the icon 
editor and the background colour of the icon listing. There are three 
rows of colour choosers:

* Top row:    Colours used in the editing screen
* Middle row: Hatches used in the editing screen
* Bottom row: Colour and hatch used for the icon listing

  On a colour system, you may well want to set all the editing-screen 
hatches to "solid" and just use colours. Conversely, on a black-and-white
system the hatches will be needed to differentiate different cells.

  Colour settings are stored in the file EDICON.CFG; delete this file to
restore the default settings.

The Image and Caption menus
===========================
  These menus can only be used when an icon is being edited. They both
describe various transformations that can be done to the icon.

The Window menu
===============

  This has two ways of arranging all the EDICON windows on the screen. It
does not affect desk accessory windows.

Creating a new application/file type
====================================

  Here is a worked example for adding a new application/file type pair to the
"high-resolution" file VIEWHI.ICN:

1. Select "Open" from the "file" menu, and browse to:

    \DRDOS\VIEWHI.ICN

2. Double-click a spare "application" icon, and design your new bitmap.
3. To set its name, click "Edit" in the bottom right-hand corner of the
  icon editor window.
4. Do the same with the corresponding document icon.
5. Save the file, run ViewMAX and see if it worked!

Technical
=========
  EDICON was compiled using Pacific C.

The file format for a GEM/ViewMax icon file is:

[DB - byte
 DW - 16-bit word, least byte first
 DD - 32-bit word, least byte first
 DS - reserve space]

	DW	nametbl	;@Pointer to names table
	DW	offset	;Subtract this value from all pointers marked @ to
			;get a 0-based pointer.

	DS	990h	;Icon table.
                        ;72 entries of length 34:
			; 8 for drives: Hard; Floppy; Folder; highlights; Networked (Viewmax only); Spare;Spare;Spare
			;32 for apps, matching the 32 name pointers below
			;32 for the equivalent document types.

	DS	...	;Up to 144 bitmaps. It is assumed that they are
			;all the same size - the size given by the first
			;entry in the icon table.
			;  If two icons have (for example) the same mask,
			;then only one copy of the bitmap is stored here;
			;so they may well be fewer than 144 bitmaps.

	DS	...	;32 0-terminated strings
nametbl:
	DS	40h	;32 @pointers to the 32 preceding strings. Each
			;   string is the description for an application /
			;   document type.

  Thus length of the file is given by
(value at word 0 - value at word 2) + 40h.

Each entry in the icon table is a GEM ICONBLK:

		DD	mask_no	;Image number for mask, zero based
		DD	spr_no	;Image number for sprite number, zero based
		DD	-1	;Caption - there is no caption
		DB	0	;Drive letter - there is none
		DB	clr	;Icon colours. Bits 0-3=background, 
				;4-7=foreground. Normally 10h, black on white.
		DW	x	;X offset for drive letter (0 if not a drive)
		DW	y	;Y offset for drive letter (0 if not a drive)
		DW	xicon	;17h for high-res icons, 0Fh for low-res
		DW	yicon	;Always 0
		DW	wicon	;Icon width, pixels
		DW	hicon	;Icon height, pixels
		DW	xtext	;0 (high res) / 4 (low res)
		DW	ytext	;Should be the same as icon height
		DW	wtext	;Width of caption. Should be 72.
		DW	htext	;Height of caption. Should be 10.

  For other icon sizes, "xicon" should equal ((78 - wicon) / 2).

Special entries are:

Icon  0: Floppy drive
Icon  1: Hard drive
Icon  2: Folder
Icon  3: Trashcan (GEM/1 and FreeGEM)
Icon  3 bitmap: drive highlight  (GEM/2, GEM/3, ViewMAX)
Icon  3 mask:   folder highlight (GEM/2, GEM/3, ViewMAX)
Icon  4: Network drive (ViewMAX only)
Icons 5-7 may be used for 5.25" floppies or CD drives in some FreeGEM
         desktops.
Icon  8 bitmap: application highlight (GEM/2, GEM/3, ViewMAX)
Icon 40 bitmap: document highlight    (GEM/2, GEM/3, ViewMAX)

Bitmaps:

A bitmap is stored line-by-line, with each line being stored as two or three
little-endian words. To get it into more conventional raster lines, each odd-
numbered byte in the line must be swapped with the even-numbered byte
to its right (this is the GEM device-independent raster format).

The idea of the @pointer is a reflection of Digital Research's original build 
process for the icons; the icons were compiled from the RCS format into an
EXE file, which would then write out the .ICN file. The "@pointers" are
relative to the EXE file's data segment, and "offset" is the address of
the ICN file within that data segment.
