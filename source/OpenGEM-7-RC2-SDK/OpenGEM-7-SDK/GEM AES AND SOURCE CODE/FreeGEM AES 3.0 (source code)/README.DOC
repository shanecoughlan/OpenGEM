README for  9/04/2000 build of the AES
======================================

  New in this build:
* Bug fixes; the Win2D setting is honoured again and the SIZER control
 is drawn.

  New in last build:
* GEM/5-style window frames now selected by GEM.CFG
* "Desk" menu can go at right or left end of menu bar
* Support for background images in EMS
* Round/square buttons and other GUI options can be set
 dynamically at run time.

New functionality over DR GEM/3
===============================

  fsel_exinput() - like fsel_input(), but takes a title as an extra parameter.

  xgrf_colour()  - set desktop colours

  xgrf_dtmfdb()  - set desktop image

  prop_get()     - get settings from global properties file
  prop_put()     - save setting to global properties file
  prop_del()     - delete setting from global properties file

  xapp_getinfo() - Implementation of the Atari appl_getinfo() function

  For details of the parameters to these calls, see my current build of the
GEM PTK.

New functionality not (yet) covered by the PTK
==============================================

  GUI options
  -----------

  prop_gui_get() (call 1013) and prop_gui_set() (call 1014) provide an
extensible interface for miscellaneous user-interface options. The syntax is:

WORD prop_gui_get(WORD option)

  Returns the value of the chosen option, zero if the option number is out
of range.

WORD prop_gui_set(WORD option, WORD value)

  Sets the chosen option to a new value. Returns the value used, which may
not be the same as the value requested.

  The option numbers are:

0 - Return count of option words (currently returns 5; valid option numbers
   are 0-4). Cannot be set.
1 - If zero, 3D objects have square corners; if nonzero, the corners are
   rounded.
2 - If zero, window frames follow the GEM/2 style; otherwise they follow
   the GEM/5 style. If this is changed at runtime, windows will have a
   strange appearance until a new program is loaded.
3 - GEM emulation mode
   This is provided for future compatibility with other AES replacements
   (such as oAESis) which have extended the AES in different ways and
   with which FreeGEM is incompatible.
    When read, this will return the emulation mode of this AES:
   0: GEM/1 subset. Programs should only assume features that are present
     in GEM/1.
   1: Atari GEM. Object flags and types have Atari semantics.
   2: FreeGEM.   Object flags and types have FreeGEM semantics.

    When written, the variable is set to 0 if the desired emulation mode be
   not available, or the requested mode if it is. Currently, only modes
   0 and 2 are available (and behave identically).

    Notes for AES authors: If you want to support FreeGEM programs, check
   the number of parameters passed to appl_init(). If there is an address
   parameter (see X_BUF_V2 below), then the program is FreeGEM aware and
   you should set your emulation mode to 2. If the program then wants to
   use Atari object flags, it should immediately call  prop_gui_set(3,1)
   to switch back to Atari mode.
4 - Menu flags
   Bit 0 set: The "Desk" menu is called "Desk" rather than taking the name
             of the current program.
   Bit 1 set: The "Desk" menu is on the left.

  Square button change
  --------------------

  The "GEM.AES.Square3D" line in GEM.CFG is now obsolete. To get buttons with
square corners, the correct settings line is "GEM.AES.Option.1: 0000".
SETTINGS.APP should be used to make this change - use the new "GUI options"
screen.

  Desktop image in EMS
  --------------------

  xgrf_dtmfdb() now returns a WORD value. If this value is nonzero, then
the image passed has been copied into EMS memory and will be used for all
programs (except those that create their own desktops, like SETTINGS.APP).
If the image has been copied into EMS memory you don't have to keep your
copy of the image. Zero will be returned if:
* There is no EMS memory.
* There is not enough EMS memory for the image.
* The image will not fit in the EMS page frame.

  Switchable shells
  -----------------

  When starting, GEM checks GEM.CFG for a line such as:

GEM.AES.Shell: NEWDESK.APP

  If this line is found, it will be taken as the name (no path) of the
  desktop program to use instead of DESKTOP.APP. The alternative desktop
  should be stored in \GEMAPPS\GEMSYS.

  You can also set the name of the desktop program to use by means of the
 xshl_setshell() call (no. 1031). This call takes one parameter in
 addr_in: the name of the desktop program (again, no path). It will return 0
 if the desktop program was set, or 1 if the name was too long.
  To get the name of the desktop program, call xshl_getshell() (call 1030).
 It takes one parameter in addr_in - the address of a buffer for the name
 of the program. This call returns 0 if the default desktop (DESKTOP.APP) is
 in use, or 1 if a different desktop has been set by use of GEM.CFG or
 xshl_setshell().
  Note that a normal GEM program is not suitable for use as a shell, since
 when it terminates it will be immediately re-run.


  GEM/5-style UI improvements
  ---------------------------

  The flag names in this section come from the 22 October 1999 release of the
 Resource Construction Set.

  3D object borders: Up to now, 3D objects have had a black border round them.
                    If you set the "White Background" (WHITEBAK) state, then
                    the black border will not be drawn.

  Sunken 3D objects: If you set the "3D background" (FL3DBAK) flag on an
                    object instead of "Draw 3D" (FLAG3D / FL3DIND) it will
                    be drawn sunken rather than raised.
                    
  "Default" symbol on buttons: If a button has the "Extended 3D" (DRAW3D)
                    state, and it is the default button, then a symbol
                    representing "Return" will be drawn on it. See
                    SETTINGS.APP for an example.

  Checkboxes:       If an object (not a button or icon) has the "Extended 3D"
                    (DRAW3D) state, and it is SELECTABLE, it will be drawn as
                    a checkbox. A tick will appear in the box if the object is
                    CHECKED or SELECTED.

                    By default, the checkbox is drawn in 3D. If it is to be
                    on a white background, the "White background" (WHITEBAK)
                    state should be selected to make the outline draw in 2D.

  Radio buttons:    A radio button is set up in exactly the same way as a
                    checkbox, but it must also have the "Radio button"
                    (RBUTTON) flag.

  The use of WHITEBAK is unfortunately rather inconsistent; it should really
work the other way round for 3D objects. I had to do it like this for
backwards compatibility.

  More colour categories
  ----------------------

   Colour categories 16-21 now exist. They are:

  16: Foreground is the 3D "light" colour.
      Background is the 3D "dark"  colour.
      Style and index are not used.

  17: Foreground is the radio button "dot" inner colour.
      Background is the radio button "dot" outer colour.
      Style and index are not used.

  18: Background is the checkbox "tick" colour.
      Foreground, style and index are not used.

  19: Foreground is the colour for window titlebar text.
      Background is the border colour for the titlebar.
      Style is nonzero if the titlebar text should be on a white
      background (as it is in GEMs 1-4 and ViewMAX).
      Index is not used.
  20: As 19, for inactive titlebars.
  21: As 19, for info lines.

  Window decorations
  ------------------

  The window decorations can be changed using wind_set() and wind_get(). This
is how:

#define WF_OBFLAG  1001	/* Window tree: flag words */
#define WF_OBTYPE  1002	/* Window tree: type words */
#define WF_OBSPEC  1003	/* Window tree: spec dwords */ 

  wind_get(n, WF_OBFLAG, &a, &b, &c, &d) - a = object flags for decoration "n"
  wind_get(n, WF_OBTYPE, &a, &b, &c, &d) - a = object type of decoration "n"
  wind_get(n, WF_OBSPEC, &a, &b, &c, &d) - (b<<16)|a = spec of decoration "n"
  wind_set(n, WF_OBFLAG,  a,  b,  c,  d) - Set flags for decoration "n" to "a"
  wind_set(n, WF_OBSPEC,  a,  b,  c,  d) - Set spec of decoration "n" to
                                           (b<<16)|a

  The "n" parameter is one of:

#define W_BOX            0  outline
#define W_TITLE	         1  titlebar outline
#define W_CLOSER         2  close box
#define W_NAME	         3  titlebar
#define W_FULLER         4  full-size box
#define W_INFO           5  info bar
#define W_DATA	         6  work area outline
#define W_WORK	         7  work area
#define W_SIZER	         8  resize box
#define W_VBAR           9  vertical scroll bar outline
#define W_UPARROW       10  scroll up box
#define W_DNARROW       11  scroll down box
#define W_VSLIDE        12  vertical scroll bar
#define W_VELEV	        13  scroll thumb
#define W_HBAR          14  horizontal scroll bar outline
#define W_LFARROW       15  scroll left box
#define W_RTARROW       16  scroll right box
#define W_HSLIDE        17  horizontal scroll bar
#define W_HELEV	        18  horizontal scroll bar thumb

How to detect this version of the AES:
======================================

Create a variable of type X_BUF_V2 (see obdefs.h) - for example:

     X_BUF_V2 var;

Initialise it to 0, and set its length member correctly:

     memset(&var, 0, sizeof(var));
     var.buf_len = sizeof(var);

Then pass the address of var to appl_init(), in addr_in[0]. This may require 
the binding to be rewritten; my Pacific and DJGPP ones have been updated to
use this form of binding.

  On return, the following values will be set:

var.buf_len = actual size of buffer returned.
var.arch    = 0 for DRI GEM, 16 for this version of GEM, 32 for any future
              32-bit AES.
var.cc      = far address of the colour structures. These are set by the
              xgrf_colour() call (no. 132) but until now there has been no
              mechanism to read their values.
var.w_active = far address of the object tree GEM uses to draw window
               decorations. This is so the glyphs on the buttons can be
               changed at runtime (eg, to the GEM/1 set). NB: The "resize"
               button in the bottom right-hand corner of the window is
               set programmatically and cannot be changed by this method.
               Use of this field is deprecated; you should use wind_set()
               and wind_get() instead. In future versions this field may
               become zero.
var.info     = far pointer to a 0-terminated string (max. 40 characters)
               containing information about the AES. For 'about' boxes and
               similar.
var.abilities = bitmapped field. Currently six bits are used:
                Bit 0 (ABLE_GETINFO) - supports an Atari-style xapp_getinfo().
                                       Set on 8/8/1999 & later builds.
                Bit 1 (ABLE_PROP)    - supports prop_get(), prop_put() and
                                       prop_del(). Set on 25/7/1999 & later
                                       builds. Properties are a compile-
                                       time option.
                Bit 2 (ABLE_WTREE)   - able dynamically to alter the window
                                       decorations using wind_get() and
                                       wind_set(). Set on 5/9/1999 & later
                                       builds.
                Bit 3 (ABLE_X3D)     - supports the GEM/5 UI enhancements.
                                       Set on 22/10/1999 & later builds.
                Bit 4 (ABLE_XSHL)    - supports xshl_getshell() and
                                       xshl_setshell(). Set on 3/12/1999 and
                                       later builds.
                Bit 5 (ABLE_PROP2)   - supports prop_gui_get() and
                                       prop_gui_set(). Set on 22/3/2000 and
                                       later builds. This is a compile-time
                                       option.
                Bit 6 (ABLE_EMSDESK) - supports loading desktop images into
                                       EMS. Set on 22/3/2000 build; this is
                                       a compile-time option.
