Support for enhanced FreeGEM features
=====================================

  GEM was GPLed in April 1999; since then I have uploaded source for a
version ("FreeGEM") containing the extra functions in ViewMAX/2 and ViewMAX/3. 
The following functions apply to FreeGEM and ViewMAX:

     WORD xgrf_colour(WORD type, WORD fg, WORD bg, WORD style, WORD index);
     WORD xgrf_dtmfdb(LPMFDB newdesk);

  (there are also extra FreeGEM-only functions - see below).

  In xgrf_colour():

  type is the user interface object type, 0-15. The ones defined in
VIEWHELP.RSC are:
#define	CC_NAME		8         /* Active titlebar */
#define	CC_SLIDER	9         /* Scrollbar background */
#define	CC_DESKTOP	10        /* Desktop */
#define	CC_BUTTON	11        /* Buttons and 3D areas */
#define	CC_INFO		12        /* Information line */
#define	CC_ALERT	13        /* Alert boxes (ignored) */
#define	CC_SLCTDNAME	14        /* Inactive titlebar */

FreeGEM adds the following types (dependent on extended 3D support):

#define CC_3DSHADE	16        /* Foreground is 3D highlight &
                                     background is 3D shadow*/
#define CC_RADIO	17        /* Foreground & background colours of *
                                   * the dot in the radio button        */
#define CC_CHECK	18        /* Background is colour of tick */


  In xgrf_dtmfdb(), the first reserved word of the MFDB contains the
display mode for the image. It can be:

#define DT_CENTER	1         Centred
#define DT_TILE		2         Tiled


There are also five extra object flags:

#define ESCCANCEL 0x200           When applied to a button, ESC is a
                                  shortcut for it.
                                  You can make ESC a shortcut for a
                                  button in form_alert(), by passing the
                                  button number in the high byte of the
                                  'default button' parameter. For example,
                                  form_alert ((3 << 8) | 1, ...) means
                                  button 1 is the default button, and
                                  button 3 has ESC as the shortcut.
#define BITBUTTON 0x400           Not used by the AES.
#define SCROLLER 0x800            When applied to a button, it may intercept
                                  "up" or "down" arrow keypresses; used in
                                  list boxes.
#define FLAG3D 0x1000             Draw object in 3D. Buttons are always 3D.
#define USECOLOURCAT 0x2000       Use the system colours set by xgrf_colour().
                                  xgrf_color(). The object's colour value
                                  becomes the ViewMAX object type, as above.
                                  3D objects always use system colours.

FreeGEM adds:

#define FL3DBAK 0x4000            Make a "sunken" 3D object rather than a
                                  "raised" one.
#define SUBMENU 0x8000            Reserved - used in Atari GEM.

and two extra object states:

#define HIGHLIGHTED 0x100	  Draw a highlight box round the object
#define UNHIGHLIGHTED 0x200       Remove the highlight box

NOTE: The supplied RCS has been extended to handle the extra flags.  This is 
an experimental RCS which you should treat with caution. Save early, save
often, and keep good backups.

FreeGEM: Extra parameter to appl_init()
=======================================

  appl_init() now takes an extra parameter; a pointer to a structure of type
X_BUF_V2. If you don't want to use this parameter, pass NULL. If a program
wants to use the extra features in FreeGEM, it must pass a valid pointer;
future GEM versions may use this as a test to see whether they should
emulate FreeGEM or Atari GEM.

  To use the structure, fill it with zeroes and set its "buf_len" member to
its size. On return, if the program is running under FreeGEM, the remainder
of the structure will be filled with data (all pointers will be linear
addresses):

typedef struct x_buf_v2
{
	WORD	buf_len;	/* Size of structure passed. Set by caller;
				 * on return, size of data returned by GEM */
	WORD	arch;	        /* 16 for 16-bit, 32 for any future 
				 * 32-bit version. 0 if not FreeGEM. */
	LONG  	cc;		/* Address of an array of 19 CLRCAT
				 * structures (containing data from
                                 * xgrf_colour() calls).
                                 * This is so that they can be read by
                                 * a program without having to fiddle
                                 * with ViewMAX.INI */
	LONG    w_active;	/* Address of the tree (18 elements)
                                 * that is used to draw window frames and
                                 * controls. The intention is that the
                                 * glyphs on the buttons could be changed
                                 * by a program. Use of this value is now
                                 * deprecated; wind_set() and wind_get()
                                 * (described below) should be used instead.
                                 */
	LONG	info;		/* ASCII information such as a version 
				 * string. This will be max. 40 characters 
				 * with no newlines */
        LONG    abilities;      /* Bit 0 (ABLE_GETINFO) is set if the AES
                                 * supports an Atari-style appl_getinfo()

FreeGEM: Property file
======================

  There is a compile-time option in the latest GEM AES to include three
extra functions: prop_get(), prop_put() and prop_del() (nos. 1010-1012).
These are used to access a global settings file. The file currently has
an extremely simple structure, but the functions allow for a more
complicated tree-structured system.

  The syntax is:

  WORD prop_get(char *program, char *section, char *buf, WORD buflen,
                WORD options);

   "program" is a name that identifies your program. It should be formed of
  one or more words separated by dots - for example, the DEMO sample uses
  "PTK.DEMO". You should avoid program names starting "GEM." to avoid a clash
  with GEM itself.
   "section" is the name of the field to retrieve. Again, this should be
  one or more words separated by dots. DEMO uses "Pen.shade", "Pen.colour" and
  "Pen.size".
   "buf" is the address of the buffer to which the information will be
  written. 
   "buflen"  is the size of "buf", including the terminating 0.
   "options" should be 0 if the setting is per-user, 1 if it is for all
            users. This is for future expansion since GEM does not
            currently support multiple user profiles. It is recommended that
            "options" should be set to 0 if at all possible.

  This function returns:
  0 - Property read successfully.
  1 - Property was not found.
 -1 - File I/O error.
 -2 - Not enough memory to do this.

  WORD prop_put(char *program, char *section, char *buf, WORD options);

  The parameters and return values are as for prop_get() above, except
 that this function will never return 1. Note that prop_get() will remove
 leading spaces from returned values, so if you are writing a string value
 that may start with spaces, you must put it in quotes before calling
 prop_put().

  WORD prop_del(char *program, char *section, WORD options);

  The parameters are as for prop_get() above.

  The current property file format is an ASCII file: \GEMAPPS\GEMSYS\GEM.CFG.
 The "program" and "section" fields are concatenated to produce a single
 string, making each line look like:

      PTK.DEMO.Pen.size: 5
      PTK.DEMO.Pen.shade: 4
      PTK.DEMO.Pen.colour: 4

  You are strongly discouraged from allowing programs to edit this file
 directly!

FreeGEM: xapp_getinfo()
=======================

  This function was added to correspond to the Atari appl_getinfo() function,
takes the same parameters and returns the same results. You can call it as
appl_getinfo() instead of xapp_getinfo() if you want.

FreeGEM: xapp_getshell() & xapp_setshell()
==========================================

  These functions are used to change the name of the shell program (normally
DESKTOP.APP).

  xapp_getshell() will return the program name (no path; it is assumed that
the program is always in \GEMAPPS\GEMSYS). It returns 0 if this is the
standard shell DESKTOP.APP, and 1 if the shell has been set using the GEM.CFG
file or xapp_setshell().

  xapp_setshell() sets the shell name. Again, no path can be passed. It
returns 0 if successful, 1 if the filename was too long.

FreeGEM: Window decorations
===========================

  The window decorations can be changed using wind_set() and wind_get(). This
is how:

#define WF_OBFLAG  1001	/* Window tree: flag words */
#define WF_OBTYPE  1002	/* Window tree: type words */
#define WF_OBSPEC  1003	/* Window tree: spec dwords */ 

  wind_get(n, WF_OBFLAG, &a, &b, &c, &d) - a = object flags for decoration "n"
  wind_get(n, WF_OBTYPE, &a, &b, &c, &d) - a = object type of decoration "n"
  wind_get(n, WF_OBSPEC, &a, &b, &c, &d) - (b<<16)|a = spec of decoration "n"
  wind_set(n, WF_OBFLAG,  a,  b,  c,  d) - Set flags for decoration "n" to "a"
  wind_set(n, WF_OBSPEC,  a,  b,  c,  d) - Set spec of decoration "n" to
                                           (b<<16)|a

  The "n" parameter is one of:

#define W_BOX            0  outline
#define W_TITLE	         1  titlebar outline
#define W_CLOSER         2  close box
#define W_NAME	         3  titlebar
#define W_FULLER         4  full-size box
#define W_INFO           5  info bar
#define W_DATA	         6  work area outline
#define W_WORK	         7  work area
#define W_SIZER	         8  resize box
#define W_VBAR           9  vertical scroll bar outline
#define W_UPARROW       10  scroll up box
#define W_DNARROW       11  scroll down box
#define W_VSLIDE        12  vertical scroll bar
#define W_VELEV	        13  scroll thumb
#define W_HBAR          14  horizontal scroll bar outline
#define W_LFARROW       15  scroll left box
#define W_RTARROW       16  scroll right box
#define W_HSLIDE        17  horizontal scroll bar
#define W_HELEV	        18  horizontal scroll bar thumb

FreeGEM: Extended 3D
====================

  FreeGEM implements an extended 3D controls system, similar to that in GEM/5.
This system works by overloading the WHITEBAK and DRAW3D flags; it is
therefore incompatible with Atari GEM, which overloads WHITEBAK differently.
If the ABLE_X3D bit is set in the AES abilities field, then the following
features are available:

* Checkboxes. Set the DRAW3D state and the SELECTABLE flag on a 2-dimensional
             object such as a G_STRING.

* Radio buttons. Set the RBUTTON flag on a checkbox.

    By default, checkboxes and radio buttons display as if on a 3D background.
  Set the WHITEBAK state to make them display correctly on a white background.

* Default buttons. Set the DEFAULT state and the DRAW3D flag on a G_BUTTON
 object, and a <=" symbol will appear on it.

* Sunken 3D objects. Set the FL3DBAK flag on them rather than FLAG3D, and
 the object will be drawn sunken.

* Ability to set 3D light/dark colours, tick and dot colours using
 xgrf_colour().

* 3D objects with no black border - set the WHITEBAK flag.
