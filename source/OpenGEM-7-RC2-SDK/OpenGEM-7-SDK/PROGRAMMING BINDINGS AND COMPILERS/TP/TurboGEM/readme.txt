TurboGEM.PAS
============

TurboGEM.PAS is a spit-and-polish update job on the original 1987 GEM/3 Turbo Pascal bindings.  I made very few modifications, so any code already using these should work with only minimal alteration.  The following changes were necessary:


   * The OBJECT record type needed to be renamed, since object is a reserved word in TP5.0+ with the advent of Object Pascal.  It is now called UIOBJECT.

   * The intr() and msdos() calls used to take a record of a user defined type.  In TP5.0+ the calls take a predefined type, called registers.  Changing this required some of the variable names to be changed, from registers to _registers to avoid clashing with the type definitions.

   * All the include files that made up the old versions have been bundled up into one unit.


The original files were: AESBIND.INC; C2PASCAL.INC; DEBUG.INC; DOSBIND.INC; MACHINE.INC; OBDEF.INC; VDIBIND.INC; VDIDEF.INC

Tidied by Rob Mitchelmore (cheesestraws), 2001.

To Do:
======

   * Fix the procedures so that the procedures which return ^UIOBJECTs so they actually do, rather than returning a pointer to the first byte, so dot syntax can be used to access the fields therein.

   * Add support for the FreeGEM gubbins.
