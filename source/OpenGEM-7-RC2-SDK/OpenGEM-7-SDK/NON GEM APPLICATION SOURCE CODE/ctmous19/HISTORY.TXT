1.9	by Arkady V.Belousov <ark@mos.ru> (documentation proofreading by

	Wolf Bergenheim <dog@users.sf.net>, Jim Lemon and Graeme England)

- Heavy source cleaning and optimization.
- INT 33/001A and 001B functions are temporarily disabled because their
  descriptions in RBIL 61 don't correspond with MS Mouse behavior and this
  causes cursor slowdown in some applications (for example, SimCity 2000).
- For the /Sn/P option combination INT 33/0024 now returns the proper IRQ#.
- INT 33/001F function now retains DTR and RTS UART lines active.
- Removed flush of mouse data stream when detecting mouse type
  (this also prevents infinite loops in some cases under Windows).
- Small mouse movements are now also doubled in auto resolution mode.
- Cursor drawing routines now recall themselves if interrupt handlers try
  to call them while drawing routines work; this should avoid differences
  between seen and real cursor status in some rare cases.
- LCR and MCR now preserved in UARTs for which no mouse is detected.
- Added additional check for PS/2 device presence (this prevents big
  delay at startup in some cases under Windows).
- Added support for 286 and 386 CPUs.
- Added external assembler library.
- Added Dutch, French, Latvian, Polish, Slovak and Spanish message files.
- Added /N command line option to force load of CuteMouse as a new TSR.
- COMTEST utility improved (and may be used to integrate IRQ auto
  detection into CuteMouse).

- Added closing of all local file handles before exit (this prevents leakage
  from system handles pool when CTMOUSE is called with redirected output and
  stays TSR).

- INT 33/0024 and 006D now report driver version 7.05 instead of 6.26.
- Implemented function INT 33/0031.
- CTMOUSE now handles INT 10/4F02 and some INT 10/11 video functions and
  correctly recalculates screen size when, for example, the screen is
  switched to 43/50 lines text mode.


1.8	by Arkady V.Belousov <ark@mos.ru> (some ideas by Alain Mouette
	<alainm@pobox.com>, documentation proofreading by Mike Millen
	<mikemillen@ukgateway.net> and Frank Markopoulos <fm666@t-online.de>)

- Bugfixes, heavy optimizations, some features.
- PS/2 pointing devices were not found on some machines.
- Serial mouse reset reinforced (previously mouse froze in some cases).
- Serial and PS/2 modules combined into one executable.
- For Mouse Systems protocol, CTMOUSE now installs at first existing
  COM port, not at COM1 which may be absent.
- Added support for serial Microsoft wheel protocol, wheel interpreted
  as third button.
- Auto resolution behavior corrected and is now default resolution.
- INT 33/001F now doesn't restore interrupts (and CTMOUSE doesn't unload
  resident part) if INT 33 or INT 10 are intercepted by another program.
- Cursor drawing much enhanced and bugfixed: finished INT 33/0010
  support and video page change detection for graphics drawing; single
  video registers handled in RIL more accurately; cursor is drawn only
  when cursor shape is inside screen ranges.
- Some ill-behaved applications (like Norton Commander or Klondike
  by Eduardo Martins) call INT 33/0001, 0009 and 000A in loops; to
  prevent cursor flickering, the cursor is now redrawn only if its
  position or pattern is changed.
- Added workarounds for Pentium and PS/2 BIOS, Logitech MouseWare
  Windows driver, Turbo Pascal IDE and Nicemouse utility peculiarities.
- Messages for English extracted into separate message file.
- Added Brazilian, Portugese, German, Italian and Hungarian message files.
- Ordered errorlevels returned for each event.
- Added /B command line option to cancel run if mouse services are
  already present.


1.73	by Arkady V.Belousov <ark@mos.ru> (many ideas by Alain Mouette
	<alainm@pobox.com>)

- Serial mouse detection routine is now CPU speed independent and also
  accepts PnP mice.
- Changed command line interface.
- Added mouse autosearch through all COM ports.
- Added support for Microsoft and PS/2 mice with 3 buttons.
- Added /W command line option to prevent loading TSR into UMB.
- Part of driver's PSP used for placing some driver data.
- Memory handling routines heavily optimized and debugged.
- Bugfixed and extended protocol analyzer possibilities.
