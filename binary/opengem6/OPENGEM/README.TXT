OpenGEM is the most stable, tested, and flexible DOS GUI distribution.

Its features include:
- 3D windows
- Automatic drive detection
- An internal file viewer
- New system fonts
- New pointer icons
- Automatically view contents of .TXT,.INF,.NFO,.BAT and .CFG files
- HP Deskjet and Postscript printing support

All of the advanced code for this distribution comes from
John Elliott.  Thank you for your hard work on FreeGEM!

John Hupp has tested and merged the HP Deskjet support into 
OpenGEM.  Without John's help this release would not have been
possible.  Thanks!

Thanks are also due to the entire FreeGEM Team, and all of 
the users who contribue comments, ideas and report bugs.
